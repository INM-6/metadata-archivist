# How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from everyone! Here’s how you can help:

## 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original project.

## 2. Create a New Branch

When you're ready to make changes, create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. Use a descriptive name for your branch, such as `feature/add-new-feature` or `bugfix/fix-issue-123`.

## 3. Make Your Changes

Make the necessary changes in your branch. Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards and includes appropriate tests.

## 4. Commit Your Changes

Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message that describes what you’ve done. For example:
```
git commit -m "Add new feature that improves user experience"
```

## 5. Push Your Changes

Push your changes back to your forked repository:
```
git push origin your-branch-name
```

## 6. Create a Pull Request

Go to the original repository and create a pull request. Provide a detailed description of your changes and why they should be merged. 

## 7. Participate in Code Review

Be open to feedback from the project maintainers. They may request changes or ask questions about your contribution.

## 8. Stay Updated

Keep your fork updated with the latest changes from the original repository to avoid merge conflicts. You can do this by regularly pulling from the upstream repository.

## Additional Guidelines

- **Issues**: If you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue on GitHub.

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Your help is greatly appreciated and helps us improve the project for everyone.
